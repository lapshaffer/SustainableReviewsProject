# Description
A site where users can post and view reviews on the sustainability of commercial brands.  The site partially operates on a by-user basis, meaning that posting reviews is restricted to only logged-in users.  The rating system is based out of 5 stars, a description is manditory for reviews to ensure that review bombing in either direction isn't as easy.
